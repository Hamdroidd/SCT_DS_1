Intentional Homicides in India – Data Visualization (WDI)

This project analyzes and visualizes data on **intentional homicides (male, per 100,000 male population)** in **India** using data extracted from the **World Development Indicators (WDI)** database.

The Python script:

* Loads homicide data from a WDI-exported `.csv` file
* Filters for India and the relevant homicide series
* Extracts annual values from 1990 to 2021 (where available)
* Plots a time series line chart showing the trend in male homicide rates

The visualization provides a clear picture of how violent crime rates (specifically male-targeted homicides) have evolved in India over the last few decades.
